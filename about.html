        <p> Camp n Go was created under the foundation of keeping the outdoor experience alive. 
            As technology advances we see the population spending less time outdoors and more time on screens, we aim to change this. 
            By offering all kinds of experiences we can fit the need of even the most picky person.
            We strive to keep the outdoors alive and thriving for centuries to come, and the best way to do that is to get people engaged. 
            Getting people active outside will open windows to all kinds of possibilites, from cleaning our oceans, to waste reduction , to preserving habitats. 
            The world needs protecting and we have chosen to awnser the call. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            The best way to get people involved with problems is to make it personal for them. Issues that are personal to us are the ones we
            most often want to help. Getting people outdoors is the best way we can make it personal, to show them that this planet needs our 
            help and is worth protecting. Doing so has created a huge influx of donations and organizatonal groups striving to clean and patch 
            up this planet we live on. We at camp and go do our part by getting people outdoors and in classes that are focoused on seeing the beauty of nature
            and the balance we as people must strive to have so we can keep this world turning. The farther we as a society fall into the technological advancments
            of the world the less we see the advancments of the world around us. Just like us mother nature is always adding and taking away in a balance that 
            is always opening new doors for discovery and wonder.

        Our companies founder has a huge passion for the perservation of the world we live on and wanted this brand to reflect as such. 
        Their love of wildlife started it all as a small child, always wanting to study and explore the living creature in their backyard 
        as well as the wildlife not as easily avaliable. As time went on different species started to decline or go exitenct entierly and this sturred
        somthing inside them. Learning to be conservative of the worlds natural resources was the first step in how to keep this planet spinning and beautiful 
        People however didnt seemed to be as concerned as they were, how could they not care about the very planet we lived on? It was because most 
        people wernt even as engaged witht the things of nature anymore, and that sparked the first flame of what would become camp and go. 
        Engaging people with the world around them has shown to be a tremandous asset in keeping the world clean, safe, and beautfiul for centuries to come.
